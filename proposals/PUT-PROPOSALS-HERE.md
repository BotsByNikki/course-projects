Put your project proposals here, naming the files `LastName-project-proposal.md` (replace `LastName` with your last name).

Submit the files by using the "Create new file" button, which will allow you to copy-paste your text into a new file, which will be submitted as a pull request. (Unfortunately, the "upload files" button doesn't work like this, and requires you to have write permissions for the repo.)
